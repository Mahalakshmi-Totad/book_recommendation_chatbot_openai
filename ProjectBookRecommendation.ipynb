If you do not follow this, you\\'ll be heavily penalised:\\n    - The values for \\'Genres\\' should have atlest one or more Genress given as input by users and format it into comma seperated list\\n    - The values for \\'Author\\' can be optional but do ask the user for thier preference, it\\'s ok if author is not provided.\\n    - The value for \\'Description\\' should be a short description of what user is looking for\\n    - The value for \\'Rating\\' should include a numerical value extracted from the user\\'s response , it can also include with less than or greater than or absolute value as well..\\n    - \\'Rating\\' value needs to be between 1 and 5 and user input can say \\'greater than a certain number\\'. The value can also be fraction value between 1 and 5. If the user says less than 0 or greater than 5, please mention that they need to provide value in given range.\\n    - Do not randomly assign values to any of the keys.\\n    - The values need to be inferred from the user\\'s response.\\n    ####\\n\\n    To fill the dictionary, you need to have the following chain of thoughts:\\n    Follow the chain-of-thoughts below and only output the final updated python dictionary for the keys as described in {\\'Genres\\': [\\'_\\'], \\'Author\\': \\'_\\', \\'Description\\': \\'_\\', \\'Rating\\': \\'_\\'}. \\n\\n    ####\\n    Thought 1: Ask a question to understand the user\\'s profile and requirements. \\n\\n    If their Genres or short description of the book is unclear. Ask followup questions to understand their and gather proper Genres.\\n    You are trying to fill the values of all the keys {\\'Genres\\',\\'Author\\',\\'Description\\',\\'Rating\\'} in the python dictionary by understanding the user requirements.\\n    Identify the keys for which you can fill the values confidently using the understanding. \\n\\n    Remember the instructions around the values for the different keys.\\n    If the necessary information has been extracted, only then proceed to the next step. \\n\\n    Otherwise, rephrase the question to capture their profile or interest clearly. \\n\\n\\n    ####\\n    Thought 2: Now, you are trying to fill the values for the rest of the keys which you couldn\\'t in the previous step.\\n    Remember the instructions around the values for the different keys.\\n    Ask questions you might have for all the keys to strengthen your understanding of the user\\'s profile or interest.\\n    If yes, move to the next Thought. If no, ask question on the keys whose values you are unsure of. \\n\\n    It is a good practice to ask question with a sound logic as opposed to directly citing the key you want to understand value for.\\n    ####\\n\\n    ####\\n    Thought 3: Check if you have correctly updated the values for the different keys in the python dictionary.\\n    If you are not confident about any of the values, ask clarifying questions.\\n    ####\\n\\n    ####\\n    Here is a sample conversation between the user and assistant:\\n    User: \"Hi, I like fiction.\"\\n    Assistant: \"Great!

To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.\"\n",
